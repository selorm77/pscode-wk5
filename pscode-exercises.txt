î°ƒ// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

i. start
ii. Input value1       # this is to prompt the user to input the first value #
iii. Input value2      # this is to prompt the user to input the second value #
iv. All values should be numeric; that is integers and float values. Ensure non-numeric values are discriminated

v. total sum should be = value1 + value2     # this is to calculate the sum of the two values, if both values are valid. #
vi.    print ( the total sum is "the calculated value from the sum of value1 and value2")
vii. else
       display or print( the value is invalid)

viii. end



// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

i. start
ii. Input your value        # the program should prompt the user to enter a value of his choice #
iii. " To check if the value is either even or odd"
iv.  If
       the value can be divided by 2 with no remainder (% 2 == 0)
v.   print( the value "is even.")     # Displays the number is even#

vi. Else
vii. print(the number, "is odd.")   # Display the number is odd

Viii. end



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


i. start
ii. for integer(i) values between 1-100
    Input a value    # prompt the user to input  a value"
iii. Ask user to input four more values (value2, value3, value4, value5)
iv. # For the average: #    
    Total sum should be = value1 + value2 + value3 + value4 + value5    # this should be displaying the total sum of all the values

    Next 
    The average should be calculated by dividing the total sum by 5 (total sum/5)
   Print( the average  of all value is "average" )

v. # To determine minimum and maximum values #
   Try to initialize the minimum value to a reference very large value
   Also initialize the maximum value to a reference very small value

vi If 
    ( a number is less than " < " the minimum value; then minimum should be equal to " = " the value)

vii And if 
    ( a number is greater than " > " the maximum value; then maximum should be equal to " = "  the value)

Viii. Display the minimum value is "smallest value"
ix. Display the maximum value is "largest value"
x. end
